## About

**F_U Paste Me** is a simple browser extension that allows pasting in input fields, ~~even~~ especially in fields where pasting has been disabled.

Made ~~in a couple of hours~~ out of frustration to improve user experience and allow pasting complex passwords copied from password managers for when autofill isn‚Äôt fully supported.

The paste shortcut is preset based on the user‚Äôs device, `‚åòCmd + V` for Mac, and `Ctrl + V` for Windows and Linux, but it can also be modified to suit individual preferences.

Works in most cases, but in case it doesn't, please feel free to open an issue or maybe even fix it yourself you lazy bastard (if you know how, of course) üòÅ.

### From source

The directory holding the manifest file can be added as an extension in developer mode in its current state. To load an unpacked extension in developer mode, first clone the repo into your local machine then follow these steps:

#### Chrome:

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
   - Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Extensions menu button and selecting **Manage Extensions** at the bottom of the menu.
   - Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over **More Tools** then selecting **Extensions**.
2. Enable **Developer Mode** by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory.

<br />

#### Firefox:

1. enter `about:debugging` in the URL bar
2. click **This Firefox**
3. click **Load Temporary Add-on**
4. open the extension's directory and select any file inside the extension, like: **minfest.json** for example.

**Note: The extension installs and remains installed until you remove it or restart Firefox.**

## Limitations

- The extension only supports force pasting in the following input types:
  - email
  - number
  - password
  - search
  - tel
  - text
  - url
- Select and replace pasting works for all supported inputs except for **email** and **number**. This is due to `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` being `null` on these types. So pasting anywhere in these fields would **_overwrite them_**.
- Force pasting in paste-disabled fields doesn't work when the field contains text that is selected in its entirety. This a side effect of a safeguard put in place to avoid duplicate pasting in the very rare case where a paste-enabled field's text is selected in its entirety and replaced with the same text as before (therefore should remain unchanged). **If you ever face this issue, simply clear the field before pasting and it should work as expected**
